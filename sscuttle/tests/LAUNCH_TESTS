Running SemanticScuttle unit tests
==================================

Prerequisites
-------------
The unit tests use PHPUnit.
For installation instructions, see http://phpunit.de/


Warning
-------
The unit tests are DESTRUCTIBLE! Never ever run them on your
normal SemanticScuttle database! Always use a different database
for testing - whole tables are emptied and re-filled during the
tests, and you will definitely lose all data in there.


Running the tests
-----------------
To run a single test class, execute it like a normal php script:
 php tests/BookmarkTest.php

To run *all* the tests, run
 php tests/AllTests.php

If you want features like code coverage, you need to use
the phpunit executable:
 phpunit --coverage-html /tmp/sc-coverage/ tests/AllTests.php
